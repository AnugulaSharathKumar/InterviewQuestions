-  **8. Soft link and hard link**:

Hard Link- A hard link is another directory entry for the same inode. Both Files share the same data

Deleting one doesn‚Äôt affect the other.  
Works only for files (not directories)  
Works within the same filesystem

Soft Link: A soft link (or symlink) is like a shortcut or pointer to another file‚Äôs name.
It‚Äôs a small file that contains the path of the target file.

Can link files or directories  
Works across filesystems 
If the original file is deleted ‚Üí link becomes broken (dangling link)

-  **10. How to remove a directory**:

```sh
rmdir directory_name
rmdir -r directory_name
rm -rf files
```
- **11. If you've run the rm command on the server and deleted everything, how will you inform the client and your manager?**:

I want to inform you that during maintenance, an rm command was accidentally run, resulting in deletion of [affected files/directories]. I have immediately stopped further operations and am now working on restoring from backup. I will provide a full impact assessment and timeline for recovery shortly.

*Prevention Measures (Follow-Up)*

Enable file system snapshots / backups

Implement rm safeguards:

Use rm -i for interactive deletion

Alias rm to rm -i for safety

Restrict root user direct deletions

Automate critical file protection ‚Äî immutable flags, access control

Incident review meeting ‚Äî discuss root cause and preventive actions

-  **12. Monolithic, Microservices, SNMP.**:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic application is a single unified unit where all components (UI, business logic, database access) are tightly coupled and run as one process.

Characteristics:

All modules are part of one codebase.
Single deployment ‚Äî updating any module requires redeploying the whole app.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Microservices Architecture

Microservices break the application into small, independent services. Each service handles a specific business function and communicates over APIs (usually REST/gRPC).

Characteristics:

Each service is independently deployable. 
Services can be written in different languages. 
Uses lightweight communication (HTTP, message queues).

3Ô∏è‚É£ SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol): 
SNMP is a protocol used to monitor and manage network devices like routers, switches, servers, and printers.

Key Components:

Managed Devices ‚Üí Routers, switches, servers.

SNMP Agent ‚Üí Software on device that reports status.

SNMP Manager ‚Üí Central system that polls devices and collects data.

Performance Monitoring

Tracks response times, latency, and throughput to ensure the application is fast and responsive.

Error Detection and Resolution

Identifies crashes, exceptions, or failed transactions quickly.

Helps reduce downtime and improve reliability.

Resource Optimization

Monitors CPU, memory, database queries, and other resources.

Helps optimize infrastructure and application performance.

Improved User Experience

Monitors end-user interactions (page load times, API response times).

Ensures smooth and consistent experience for users.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Detects which service, code, or database query is causing performance issues.

Proactive Alerts and Notifications

Sends alerts when performance thresholds are crossed.

Helps teams react before users are affected.

Business Insights

Provides analytics on application usage, peak traffic, and trends.

Supports capacity planning and scaling decisions.
